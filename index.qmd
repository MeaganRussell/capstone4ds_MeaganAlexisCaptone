Paper One: Random Forest Algorithm Overview

This paper provides an overview of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Random Forest is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a target variable known as a dependent variable. The goal of Random Forest is to predict the dependent variable based on independent variables. The way RF works is by creating decision trees. Decision trees are a series of yes/no questions, for example: 


Did the flooding cause any deaths? 

Did the flooding result in more than $1,000,000 in property damage?

Did the flood occur countywide?

Did the flood cause agricultural damage?


The authors go on to explain how Random Forest is a smart model that uses simple models, decision trees, which each can make small mistakes, but in the end, once all of the simple models are combined, they get the answer right. In addition, each decision tree's selection of data is random, which prevents the model from memorizing the data. There are limitations to Random Forest, such as increased computational cost and reduced transparency; however, overall Random Forest is reliable, widely applicable, and suitable for real-world problems.
